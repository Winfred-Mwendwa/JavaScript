# Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a responsive css framework.
Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name responsive design.
With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.


~Make images mobile responsive by adding the img-responsive class.
~Center text by adding the text-center class.
~Create a Bootstrap button by adding the btn and btn-default classes to the button element.
~Make Bootstrap buttons block elements by adding btn-block class;cover entire horizontal width of page, following elements are added on the next line
~The btn-primary class is the main color you'll use in your app. It is useful for highlighting actions you want your user to take.
~Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take.
~The btn-danger class is the button color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action.

~Bootstrap uses a responsive 12-column grid system, which makes it easy to put elements into rows and specify each element's relative width. 
~Most of Bootstrap's classes can be applied to a div element.
~Bootstrap has different column width attributes that it uses depending on how wide the user's screen is.
~Take for example Bootstrap's col-md-* class. Here, md means medium, and * is a number specifying how many columns wide the element should be.

~Nest the elements you want to put in a row within a single div with a class=row element.
~Nest each individual element in a col-xs-* element (xs-extra small screen) or md for medium screen size such as a laptop
~Also applies to form elements as well

~You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! 
~This way, our radio buttons?check boxes will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

~All textual input, textarea, and select elements with the class .form-control have a width of 100%.
